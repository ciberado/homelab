# Tailscale notes

I'm Javi Moreno. You can reach me at "email at javier-moreno dot com". 
I love explaining things that I find interesting to others, and I enjoy 
learning new topics from them.

Currently, I'm working at NTT Data as a Principal Cloud Consultant, and 
I'm also co-directing the best
[Cloud Computing Postgraduate Course](https://www.talent.upc.edu/ing/estudis/formacio/curs/319400/posgrado-cloud-computing-architecture/)
in Spanish at the UPC School, 
which is part of the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya
(all thanks to the amazing teachers who deliver the content).

Here are my notes on how I've set up my HomeLab. You'll find some 
silly but fun slides and the cookbook that I mainly use to document my progress.

I'd love to receive your pull requests, so don't be shy. Also, feel 
free to contact me if I can assist you with anything.

Cheers!
